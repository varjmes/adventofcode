// You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.
// These aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once
// involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to
// the right many times

// Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3
// and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?
