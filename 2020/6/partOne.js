// --- Day 6: Custom Customs ---
// The form asks a series of 26 yes-or-no questions marked a through z. All you
// need to do is identify the questions for which anyone in your group answers
// "yes". Since your group is just you, this doesn't take very long.

// Each group's answers are separated by a blank line, and within each group, each
// person's answers are on a single line.

// For each group, count the number of questions to which anyone answered "yes".
// What is the sum of those counts?
