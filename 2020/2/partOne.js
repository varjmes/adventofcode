// --- Day 2: Password Philosophy ---
// Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password
//  policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must
// appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the
// password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.

// How many passwords are valid according to their policies?
